Lab 1 assignment

I used a variation of resources throughout trying to get this lab done.  Unfortunately, I did not use my time wisely and am now out of time with no idea how to get the last two numbers from the files I have.  A lot of the websites I visited only dealt with strings in the files or newline grabs using getline, instead of just using whitespace to separate the numbers.

I managed to get the files open and read in by my program and I could get the first and second number of the file but the last 2 remain a mystery to me. I ran out of time to get the rest of them figured out and just want to get at least something turned in.  The main is pretty extensive but most of it is commented out code for trial and error that is there just for my personal use.  If in the future you want me to remove all that just let me know and I can clean it up for submission

Thanks
